### Stack:
- react
- nextjs
- react-bootstrap

### Installation
Install dependencies (make sure you have nodejs and npm or yarn installed)

    // with npm
    npm install
    
    // with yarn
    yarn install
    
Run it

    // with npm
    npm run dev

    // with yarn
    yarn run dev
    
Or you can create production build

    // with npm
    npm run build

    // with yarn
    yarn run build
    
And then run it

    // with npm
    npm run start

    // with yarn
    yarn run start
    
### In my opinion
SSG and NextJS is a perfect way if you can prerender pages.
